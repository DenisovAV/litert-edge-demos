# Platform setup and memory limits for on-device models

This document lists the platform entries a Flutter app needs before flutter_gemma can load an on-device model on Android, iOS, macOS, Windows, Linux and the web, and explains the memory limits that decide whether a large model loads or the app is killed: iOS memory entitlements, the iOS Simulator GPU cap, Android architectures, desktop drivers, browser limits and practical memory advice. Without these entries the app builds and then fails at model load, or is killed for memory.

## Android minimum SDK and internet permission

Set `minSdk = 30` in `android/app/build.gradle.kts` (or `build.gradle`) under `defaultConfig`. `minSdk 30` covers everything built on `.litertlm`: inference, embeddings and speech. On API 29 the native library fails to load at runtime — the build does not catch it. MediaPipe `.task` models run on lower API levels.

`android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` needs the internet permission to download a model:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

Flutter's template declares it only for debug and profile builds, so without this line the release build cannot download.

Add-to-app hosts must declare the Kotlin Gradle Plugin themselves, because Flutter auto-applies it to plugin modules only when the host provides it; a normal `flutter build` app needs nothing.

## Android architectures: arm64-v8a only for LiteRT features

Only `arm64-v8a` is shipped for `.litertlm`. Everything backed by `libLiteRtLm` — `.litertlm` inference including vision and audio input, embeddings via LiteRT FFI, and speech STT and TTS — is `arm64-v8a` only and does not run on `x86_64` or `armeabi-v7a`. MediaPipe text inference (`.task` and `.bin`) also works on `x86_64` and `armeabi-v7a`.

If an Android app uses only the arm64-only features, restrict the build to arm64 so the Play Store does not offer broken APKs to incompatible devices:

```gradle
android { defaultConfig { ndk { abiFilters 'arm64-v8a' } } }
```

## Android GPU and NPU manifest entries

GPU needs nothing added. Since 1.2.0 flutter_gemma's own manifest declares the OpenCL entries, and the manifest merger folds them into the app. If you pin or audit the merged manifest, it must contain `uses-native-library` entries (all with `android:required="false"`) for `libvndksupport.so`, `libOpenCL.so`, `libOpenCL-car.so`, `libOpenCL-pixel.so` and `libcdsprpc.so`.

`libvndksupport.so` matters above all: without it the OpenCL driver load is denied on Android 12 and later, the engine falls back to WebGPU, and some Mali GPUs hard-freeze. `libcdsprpc.so` is for the Qualcomm NPU. `flutter_gemma_litertlm` is delivered as a Native Assets library with no MediaPipe Java classes, so it needs no ProGuard rules; `flutter_gemma_mediapipe` ships its own consumer ProGuard rules from 1.0.6.

## Android foreground service for large model downloads

Android has a 9-minute background execution limit. For large models you can opt into foreground service mode with `fromNetwork(url, foreground: true)`, which shows a notification and exempts the download from battery-optimization kills; it does not raise WorkManager's own 9-minute task timeout. The default, `null`, uses no foreground service, and `false` never uses one. iOS uses native URLSession, which handles long downloads automatically.

Foreground downloads request the `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` runtime permission before the download starts; on Android 13 and later the permission must also be granted at runtime for the foreground service to activate. If the user denies it, the download silently falls back to background. On Android 14 (API 34) and later, the host app must declare the `FOREGROUND_SERVICE_DATA_SYNC` permission and override WorkManager's `SystemForegroundService` with `android:foregroundServiceType="dataSync"`; without this, `foreground: true` downloads crash on API 34+ devices.

## iOS minimum version and static linking

The minimum is iOS 15.0 — 16.0 if the app includes `flutter_gemma_mediapipe`, which needs MediaPipe GenAI. Core, `flutter_gemma_litertlm` and embeddings build from 15.0.

With CocoaPods, declare in `ios/Podfile`, once, `platform :ios, '15.0'` and `use_frameworks! :linkage => :static`. CocoaPods rejects a second platform declaration. With Swift Package Manager — the default since Flutter 3.44 — there is no Podfile: set iOS Deployment Target on the Runner target in Xcode instead, or the build fails with `requires minimum platform version 15.0`. `flutter_gemma_mediapipe` has no `Package.swift`, so an app using it gets a Podfile as well; set the platform there too.

No host-side Podfile `post_install` is required on iOS: flutter_gemma patches the LiteRT-LM `dlopen` path so dyld resolves Metal accelerators directly through the Native Assets framework, which also keeps the app bundle App Store clean.

## iOS memory entitlements for large models

In Xcode, under Signing and Capabilities, add Extended Virtual Addressing and Increased Memory Limit. That writes these keys to `ios/Runner/Runner.entitlements` and links the file to the target — a file edited by hand but not linked does nothing. Without them large models are killed for memory.

```xml
<key>com.apple.developer.kernel.extended-virtual-addressing</key>
<true/>
<key>com.apple.developer.kernel.increased-memory-limit</key>
<true/>
```

The README example also adds `com.apple.developer.kernel.increased-debugging-memory-limit`. Other iOS `Info.plist` entries from the setup guide are `UIFileSharingEnabled` to enable file sharing, `NSLocalNetworkUsageDescription` for local network access during development, and the optional `CADisableMinimumFrameDurationOnPhone` performance setting.

## Why the iOS Simulator is CPU-only

The iOS Simulator cannot run GPU inference; use the CPU there, or a real device. The iOS Simulator's Metal has a 256 MB single-allocation cap that LLM weight tensors exceed — Gemma 3 1B's KV cache alone is 288 MB. On a physical iPhone, `.litertlm` runs on the FFI engine with the GPU via Metal, and vision and audio are supported on physical devices. Audio input on iOS is device-only.

## macOS entitlements for downloading and loading LiteRT-LM

Add two keys to both `macos/Runner/DebugProfile.entitlements` and `macos/Runner/Release.entitlements`: `com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation` and `com.apple.security.network.client`, each set to true.

`network.client` lets the sandboxed app download the model — without it the request fails with `Operation not permitted`. `disable-library-validation` matters once Hardened Runtime is on, which notarization requires: the build phase signs LiteRT-LM and its companion libraries ad hoc, and library validation refuses code that is not signed by Apple or by the app's own team. Add both keys to both files — the debug and release builds read different ones.

Do not copy the iOS `com.apple.developer.kernel.*` keys into these files; they are iOS entitlements. Without a signing team the build fails with `"Runner" has entitlements that require signing with a development certificate`, and a team-signed build silently drops them. A `.litertlm` model loads on macOS without them.

## macOS build phase for LiteRT-LM companion libraries

`.litertlm` on macOS also needs a build phase that copies the LiteRT-LM companion libraries into the app, because the package deliberately keeps them out of Native Assets and nothing else puts them in the bundle. The upstream Apple companion libraries (`libGemmaModelConstraintProvider.dylib` and `libLiteRtMetalAccelerator.dylib`) were linked without `-Wl,-headerpad_max_install_names`, so the Native Assets JIT bundling path cannot rewrite their install name.

With CocoaPods, a `post_install` block from the setup guide is pasted into `macos/Podfile`, adding a Run Script phase named `[flutter_gemma] Setup LiteRT-LM macOS` to the Runner target only; the phase locates and runs a staging script that `flutter_gemma_litertlm` installs from its build hook. A Swift Package Manager app has no `macos/Podfile`: either turn SPM off for the project, or add the same Run Script phase by hand in Xcode. Without it the build succeeds and the model fails to load at runtime — `LiteRtLm.dylib` links the constraint provider directly and fails to load on every backend, CPU included.

## Desktop architecture: LiteRT-LM via dart:ffi without a JVM

Desktop platforms run LiteRT-LM directly via `dart:ffi`. The previous Kotlin and JVM gRPC server is gone — no Java required, no separate process, no IPC overhead — and engine startup is about 2 seconds instead of 10–15 seconds. Native libraries are fetched at build time by `hook/build.dart` from a GitHub release, SHA256-verified, and bundled by Flutter Native Assets. The Dart FFI layer is shared with mobile: Android and iOS use the same client against the same C API.

Desktop accepts only LiteRT-LM `.litertlm` files; MediaPipe `.bin` and `.task` models won't load on desktop. Supported desktop targets are macOS arm64 (Apple Silicon) with Metal, Windows x86_64 with DirectX 12 via Dawn and WebGPU, and Linux x86_64 and arm64 with Vulkan via Dawn and WebGPU, all with vision and audio. Intel Macs and Windows on arm64 are not supported. Requirements are Flutter 3.44.0 or later and Dart SDK 3.12.0 or later; GPU drivers need WebGPU, Vulkan, Metal or DirectX 12 support, and the engine falls back to CPU if not available.

## Windows desktop setup

Nothing needs to be added to the project. The native libraries — including the Windows GPU shader compiler and NPU runtime — are bundled at build time. The bundle includes `LiteRtLm.dll`, `LiteRt.dll`, the WebGPU accelerator and sampler, `webgpu_dawn.dll`, the DirectX Shader Compiler runtime (`dxil.dll` and `dxcompiler.dll`), and `LiteRtDispatch.dll` with the OpenVINO runtime and TBB for the Intel NPU behind `PreferredBackend.npu` on Lunar Lake and Panther Lake.

End users need nothing installed. Since `flutter_gemma_litertlm` 1.7.1 `LiteRtLm.dll` is linked against the static CRT and imports none, and 16 of its 24 DLLs import none. The other eight are the Intel NPU stack, importing only runtimes a Flutter Windows app already resolves, and they are loaded only when that backend is selected. If GPU shaders fail to compile and the app silently falls back to CPU, check that `dxcompiler.dll` and `dxil.dll` sit next to the app executable, then look at the GPU driver.

## Linux desktop setup and Vulkan drivers

Building needs `clang cmake ninja-build libgtk-3-dev lld`. The runtime needs glibc 2.34 or later and libstdc++ 6.0.30 or later (Ubuntu 22.04+, Debian 12+, Fedora 36+, RHEL 9+).

Linux GPU uses Dawn and WebGPU on top of Vulkan, so a working vendor Vulkan driver is required (NVIDIA, AMD or Intel). On NVIDIA install the proprietary driver; on Intel and AMD the open-source Mesa driver works on most distributions. Mesa's `llvmpipe` software fallback cannot run Gemma 4: its hardcoded 128 MB `maxStorageBufferRange` is below the model's per-buffer requirement. For headless use without a display, `Xvfb` is enough as a fake display. A `glibc 2.38 not found` error on Ubuntu 22.04 means a stale copy is being loaded from the build cache; clearing `~/.cache/flutter_gemma/native` lets the hook re-fetch the release.

## Where desktop apps store downloaded models

Desktop builds store downloaded models outside the user's `Documents/` folder to avoid OneDrive, iCloud or Domain Roaming sync corrupting the memory-mapped access to large `.litertlm` files:

- Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\flutter_gemma\` (never OneDrive-synced)
- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/<bundle>/flutter_gemma/`
- Linux: `~/.local/share/<app>/flutter_gemma/`

On mobile, Android and iOS store models in the local file system in the app documents directory. LiteRT-LM caches compiled GPU shaders in the app's support directory as `<model>.litertlm_<mtime>_<size>_mldrift_program_cache.bin`; the name is keyed on the model file's timestamp and size, so a new model build gets a fresh cache by itself.

## Web setup: script tags and model storage helpers

All script tags go in `web/index.html` `<head>`, before Flutter boots. Every web app needs the model storage helpers: copy `cache_api.js` and `opfs_helper.js` from the flutter_gemma package's `web/` directory into the app's `web/`, and load them with script tags. Then add the script for each engine package used: the `.litertlm` engine loads `@litert-lm/core` from a CDN as an ES module and exposes a `window.litertLmReady` promise that resolves to the `Engine` constructor; MediaPipe loads `@mediapipe/tasks-genai`. Web RAG with `flutter_gemma_rag_sqlite` needs the package's custom `sqlite3.wasm` copied into the web root and the app served with cross-origin isolation headers.

The `.litertlm` web engine loads the web build of a model — `gemma-4-E2B-it-web.litertlm` (2.0 GB, so use streaming storage), not `gemma-4-E2B-it.litertlm`. It is text-only: no images, audio or LoRA, and no Gemma 4 thinking. A `--dart-define` token is compiled into `main.dart.js`, where every visitor can read it, so serve web users a model from a repo that needs no token.

## Web storage modes: Cache API, OPFS streaming and ephemeral

The storage mode is set in `FlutterGemma.initialize(webStorageMode: ...)`.

- `WebStorageMode.cacheApi`, the default, uses the browser Cache API with Blob URLs. Models persist across browser restarts. It is best for models under about 2 GB.
- `WebStorageMode.streaming` uses OPFS with a ReadableStream and bypasses the browser's 2 GB ArrayBuffer limit. It is required for large models (E4B at 4 GB and up, 7B, 27B) and requires Chrome 86+, Edge 86+ or Safari 15.2+. Use it when shipping `.litertlm` web models: the `@litert-lm/core` engine consumes an OPFS stream and avoids Chrome's roughly 2 GB blob-fetch limit on the Gemma 4 E2B and E4B web builds.
- `WebStorageMode.none` keeps models in memory only; they are cleared when the browser closes and download on every launch, which suits testing and demos. Combined with a model over 2 GB it trips Chrome's `ERR_BLOB_OUT_OF_MEMORY`.

`FlutterGemma.isStreamingSupported()` checks whether streaming is available.

## Web memory and browser cache limits

Large models may hit browser memory limits, typically 2 GB. Smaller models (1B–2B) are recommended for the web. The best models for web are Gemma 3 270M (300 MB), Gemma 3 1B (500 MB–1 GB) and Gemma 3n E2B (3 GB), which requires 6 GB or more of device RAM. The maximum model size in the browser cache is about 2 GB on Chrome and Firefox, an ArrayBuffer limit, and about 50 MB on Safari, which is not suitable. On the web, downloads create blob URLs in browser memory rather than files, tokens are stored in browser memory rather than localStorage, and custom model servers must enable CORS headers; Hugging Face already has CORS configured correctly.

## Memory considerations for on-device models

- Model size: larger models, such as 7B, might be too resource-intensive for on-device inference.
- Multimodal models: Gemma 3n models with vision support require more memory and are recommended for devices with 8 GB or more of RAM.
- iOS memory requirements: large models require memory entitlements in `Runner.entitlements`.
- Each open chat session holds its own context, about 100–500 MB depending on model and context size, so several concurrent sessions with Gemma 4 E2B or larger can run out of memory on phones.
- On Android the GPU shares system memory, so on a 4–6 GB phone running out of GPU memory can end the app rather than fall back to CPU.
- The `flutter_gemma_diagnostics` package measures what a model costs in memory the OS cannot reclaim, read from the OS, on Android and iOS.

## Fixing out-of-memory problems

- On iOS, ensure `Runner.entitlements` contains the memory entitlements and is linked to the target.
- Reduce `maxTokens` if experiencing memory issues, because it sets the context window and KV-cache size.
- Use smaller models (1B–2B parameters) for devices with less than 6 GB of RAM.
- Close sessions and models when not needed.
- Monitor token usage with `sizeInTokens()`.
- Keep one loaded model and create cheap sessions on it rather than loading a model per chat; cap concurrent sessions with `maxConcurrentSessions:` on `getActiveModel`.
